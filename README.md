# design-to-spec
This project was an opportunity to utilize my knowledge of CSS to create a web page based on an image. Creating this site gave me the experience of working with a client and creating a product based on their wants and needs.

# Tools
This site was made with HTML and CSS.

# Future Plans
None!
